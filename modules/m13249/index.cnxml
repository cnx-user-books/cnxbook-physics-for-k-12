<para id="id17403395">Answer to this question is vital to justify
yet another course (book) on the subject, specially when, there
exists brilliant books on the shelves, successfully meeting the
requirement of schools. Understandably, each of these books /
courses has been developed through a rigorous process, conforming
to a very high level of standards prescribed by state education
boards. Why then yet another course (book)? Matter of
fact, this question had been uppermost in my mind before I
undertook the commitment to take up this project. A good part of
the reason lies in the basic nature of creative urge involved in
writing and shaping a book. Besides, as an author, I had the strong
conviction like others that a subject matter can always be treated
in yet another way, which may be a shade different and may be a shade
better than earlier efforts. This belief probably clinched my
initiation into this project. Further :</para>
<para id="id22356920">1 : It is no wonder that books have been
published regularly - many of which have contributed significantly
to the understanding of the nature and natural events. Also,
there is no doubt that there has been a general
improvement in the breath and depth of the material and style of
presentation in the new books, leading to a better appreciation
among the readers about the powerful theories, propounded by great
human minds of all time. However, one book differs to other in
content, treatment, emphasis and presentation. This book is
different on this count.</para>
<para id="id21666001">2 : Fundamental laws of physics are simple in
construct. Take the example of Newton’s second law : <m:math display="inline"><m:mi mathvariant="bold">F</m:mi><m:mo> =</m:mo> <m:mi> m</m:mi> <m:mi mathvariant="bold">a</m:mi> </m:math>. This
could not have been simpler. Yet, it takes great deal of
insight and practice to get to the best of mechanics
– a branch of physics, which is largely described by this simple
construct. The simplicity of fundamental laws, matter of fact, is
one of the greatest wonders of nature. Difficulty arises, mostly,
from the complexity of the context of natural phenomena, which are
generally culmination of a series of smaller events interwoven in
various ways. The challenge here is to resolve complex natural
phenomena into simpler components, which can then be subjected to
the theories of physics. Resolution of complex natural phenomena
into simpler components is an important consideration in physics. This
book keeps this aspect of physics central to its treatment of the
subject matter.</para>
<para id="id22587828">3 : Overwhelming and awesome reach of
theories in physics, inadvertently, introduces a sense of finality
and there is a tendency to take an approach towards the study of
physics, which is serene and cautious – short of
‘do_not_fool_around’ kind of approach. This book takes calculated
risk to play around with the hypotheses and theories to initiate
readers to think deeper and appreciate physics with all its
nuances. The book is structured and developed from the perspective
of inquisitive young minds and not from the perspective of a
matured mind, tending to accept theory at its face value. This
shift in approach is the cornerstone of subject treatment in this
book.</para>
<para id="id22416757">4 : Mathematics fine tunes physics laws and
gives it a quantitative stature. Most of the extension of physical
laws into the realm of application is possible with the intelligent
use of mathematical tools at our disposal. Further, adaptation of
physical laws in mathematical form is concise and accurate.
Consider the magnetic force on a moving charge given by :</para>
<para id="id22425792"><m:math>
		<m:mi mathvariant="bold">F</m:mi>
		<m:mo> = </m:mo>
		<m:mi>q</m:mi>
                <m:mo> ( </m:mo>
		<m:mi mathvariant="bold">v</m:mi>
		<m:mo>X</m:mo>
		<m:mi mathvariant="bold">B</m:mi>
		<m:mo>)</m:mo>
	</m:math>
</para>
<para id="id22042728">The mathematical expression is complete and
accurate. It tells us about both magnitude and direction of the
magnetic force on the moving charge. Matter of fact, direction
of force in relation to velocity of charge and
magnetic field is difficult to predict without this formula.
Either, we rely on additional rules like Fleming’s left hand rule
or interpret the vector quantities on the right hand side of the
equation in accordance with rules concerning cross product of two
vectors. The choice of mathematical vector interpretation is found to
avoid confusion as Fleming’s rule requires that we memorize
direction of each of the vectors by a specific finger from the set
of three fingers stretched in mutually perpendicular directions.
There is great deal of uncertainty involved. You may forget to
remember the correct hand (left or right), correct fingers (first, middle or thumb)and what each of them
represents. On the other hand, vector interpretation has no element
to memorize to predict the direction of magnetic force! Such is the
power of mathematical notation of physical law.</para>
<para id="id22391796">In this sense, mathematics is a powerful tool
and preferred language of expression in physics. Separate modules
are devoted to describe mathematics relevant to physics in order to
prime readers before these tools are used in the context of
physics.</para>
<para id="id22414472">5 : The fundamental laws/ theories of physics
are universal and result of great insight into the realm of
physical proceedings. New constructs and principles are difficult
to come by. The last defining moment in physics was development of
the quantum physics by Erwin Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg in
the year 1925-26. Since then, there had been advancement in the
particle physics and electronics, but no further aggregation of new
theories of fundamental nature. Physics, however, has progressed a
great deal in its application to other spheres of science,
including engineering, medicine and information technology. This
book assigns due emphasis to this aspect of applied physics.</para>
<para id="id22139443">6 : Various Boards of State Education prescribe well thought out framework and standards for
development of physics text book for classroom teaching. This book
emphasizes these standards and goals set up by the Boards. </para>
