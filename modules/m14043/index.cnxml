Third law of motion is different to other two laws of motion in what it describes. This law states about an important characteristic of force rather than the relation between force and motion as described by the first two laws.

</para>
<para id="element-3">The action and reaction pair acts along the same line. Their points of application are different as they act on different bodies. This is a distinguishing aspect of third law with respect first two laws, which consider application of force on a single entity.
</para>
<para id="element-3a">The law underlines the basic manner in which force comes into existence. Force results from interaction of two bodies, always appearing in pair. In other words, the existence of single force is impossible. In the figure below, we consider a block at rest on a table. The block presses the table down with a force equal to its weight (mg). The horizontal table surface, in turn, pushes the block up with an equal normal force (N), acting upwards.

In this case, the net force on the block and table is zero. The force applied by the table on the block is equal and opposite to the force due to gravity acting on it. As such, there is no change in the state of block. Similarly, net force on the table is zero as ground applies upward reaction force on table to counterbalance the force applied by the block. We should, however, be very clear that these action and reaction force arising from the contact are capable to change the state of motion of individual bodies, provided they are free to move. Consider collision of two billiard balls. The action and reaction forces during collision change the course of motion (acceleration of each ball).  
</para>

<para id="element-608">The "action" and "reaction" forces are external forces on individual bodies. Depending on the state of a body (i.e. the state of other forces on the body), the individual "action" or "reaction" will cause acceleration in the particular body. For this reason, book and table do not move on contact, but balls after collision actually moves with certain acceleration. </para>
<para id="element-6">
The scope of this force is not limited to interactions involving physical contact. This law appears to apply only when two bodies come in contact. But, in reality, the characterization of force by third law is applicable to all force types. This requirement of pair existence is equally applicable to forces like electrostatic or gravitational force, which act at a distance without coming in contact.

We have pointed out that “action” and “reaction” forces are external forces on the individual bodies. However, if we consider two bodies forming a “system of two bodies”, then action and reaction pairs are internal to the system of two bodies. The forces on the system of bodies are :

The internal forces are incapable to produce acceleration of the system of bodies. The term “system of bodies” is important (we shall discuss the concept of system of bodies and their motion in separate module). The acceleration of the system of bodies is identified with a point known as <link document="m14119">center of mass</link>. When we say that no acceleration is caused by the pair of third law forces, we mean that the “center of mass” has no acceleration. Even though individual body of the system is accelerated, but “center of mass” is not accelerated and hence, we say that "system of bodies" is not accelerated.
