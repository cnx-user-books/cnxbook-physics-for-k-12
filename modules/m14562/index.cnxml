<para id="element-75">Transformation of graphs means changing graphs. This generally allows us to draw  graphs of more complicated functions from graphs of basic or simpler functions by applying different transformation techniques. It is important to emphasize here that plotting a graph is an extremely powerful technique and method to know properties of a function such as domain, range, periodicity, polarity and other features which involve differentiability of a function. Subsequently, we shall see that plotting enables us to know these properties more elegantly and easily as compared to other analytical methods.

<para id="element-76">Graphing of a given function involves modifying graph of a core function. We modify core function and its graph, applying various mathematical operations on the core function. There are two fundamental ways in which we operate on core function and hence its graph. We can either modify input to the function or modify output of function.

It is a plot of values of function against independent variable x. The value of function changes in accordance with function rule as x changes. Graph depicts these changes pictorially. In the current context, both core function and modified function graphs are plotted against same independent variable x.

<section id="section-5b">
<title>Input to the function</title>
<para id="element-81"> What is input to the function? How do we change input to the function? Values are passed to the function through argument of the function. The argument itself is a function in x i.e. independent variable. The simplest form of argument is "x" like in function f(x). The modified arguments are "2x" in function f(2x) or "2x-1" in function f(2x-1). This changes input to the function. Important to underline is that independent variable x remains what it is, but argument of the function changes due to mathematical operation on independent variable. Thus, we modify argument though mathematical operation on independent variable x. Basic possibilities of modifying argument i.e. input by using arithmetic operations on x are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and negation. In notation, we write modification to the input of the function as :

<title>Effect of arithmetic operations </title>

<para id="element-97">

Addition/ subtraction operation on independent variable results in shifting of core graph along x-axis i..e horizontally. Similarly, product/division operations results in scaling (shrinking or stretching) of core graph horizontally. The change in graphs due to negation is reflected as mirroring (across y–axis) horizontally. Clearly, modifications resulting from modification to input modifies core graph horizontally. Another important aspect of these modification is that changes takes place opposite to that of operation on independent variable. For example, when “2” is added to independent variable, then core graph shifts left which is opposite to the direction of increasing x. A multiplication by 2 shrinks the graph horizontally by  a factor 2, whereas division by 2 stretches the graph by a factor of 2. 


</para>
<para id="element-98">On the other hand, modification in the output of function is reflected in change in graphs along y-axis i.e. vertically. Effects such as shifting, scaling (shrinking or stretching) or mirroring across x-axis takes place in vertical direction. Also, the effect of modification in output is in the direction of modification as against effects due to modifications to input. A multiplication of function by a positive constant greater than 1, for example, stretches the graph in y-direction as expected. These aspects will be clear as we study each of the modifications mentioned here.

<para id="element-103">The form of representation appears to be cumbersome, but is more explicit in its intent. It delinks sign from the magnitude of constants. In this case, the signs preceding positive constants need to be interpreted for the nature of transformation. For example, a negative sign before c denotes right horizontal shift. It is, however, clear that both representations are essentially equivalent and their use depends on personal choice or context. This difference does not matter so long we understand the process of graphing.

<para id="element-104">In order to understand this type of transformation, we need to explore how output of the function changes as input to the function changes. Let us consider an example of functions f(x) and f(x+1). The integral values of inedependent variable are same as integral values on x-axis of coordinate system. Note that independent variable is plotted along x-axis as real number line.  The integral x+1 values to the function f(x+1) - such that input values are same as that of f(x) - are shown on a separate line just below x-axis. The corresponding values are linked with arrow signs. Input to the function f(x+1) which is same as that of f(x) corresponds to x which is 1 unit smaller. It means graph of f(x+1) is same as graph of f(x), which has been shifted by 1 unit towards left. Else, we can say that the origin of plot (also x-axis) has shifted right by 1 unit.

Important thing to note about horizontal scaling (shrinking or stretching) is that it takes place with respect to origin of the coordinate system and along x-axis – not about any other point and not along y-axis. What it means that behavior of graph at x=0 remains unchanged. In equivalent term, we can say that y-intercept of graph remains same and is not affected by scaling resulting from multiplication or division of the independent variable.

<para id="element-54">A graph of a function is drawn for values of x in its domain. Depending on the nature of function, we plot function values for both negative and positive values of x. When sign of the independent variable is changed, the function values for negative x become the values of function for positive x and vice-versa. It means that we need to flip the plot across y-axis. 
In the nutshell, the graph of y=f(-x) can be obtained by taking mirror image of the graph of y=f(x) in y-axis.
</para>
<para id="element-56">While using this transformation, we should know about even function. For even function. f(x)=f(-x). As such, this transformation will not have any implication for even functions as they are already symmetric about y-axis. It means that two parts of the graph of even function across y-axis are image of each other. For this reason, y=cos(-x) = cos(x), y = |-x|=|x| etc. The graphs of these even functions are not affected by change in sign of independent variable.
