Questions and their answers are presented here in the module text format as if it were an extension of the treatment of the topic. The idea is to provide a verbose explanation, detailing the application of theory. Solution presented is, therefore, treated as the part of the understanding process – not merely a Q/A session. The emphasis is to enforce ideas and concepts, which can not be completely absorbed unless they are put to real time situation.

Since there are two separate strings. Tensions in two strings are different. We see here that block -1 has no attachment to its left. Hence, it would involve minimum numbers of forces. Thus, we start from block -1.

<para id="element-29">Since strings are taught, it is evident that the acceleration of the blocks and string are same. Also, we note that motion of the blocks on the table is in horizontal direction only. There is no motion in vertical direction. The forces in the vertical direction, therefore, constitute a balanced force system. Thus, for the analysis of motion, the consideration of forces in vertical directions for blocks of masses “

</figure>
</para>
<para id="element-66">If we look closely at the forces on the block "B", then we realize that tension in the string is equal to external force "F". These tensions act on the block "B" through two attached pulleys. Knowing that tension in the string is same everywhere, we could have neglected all the four tensions as far as block "B" is concerned. They form two pairs of equal and opposite forces and, therefore, tensions form a balanced force system for block "B".
</para>
<para id="element-67">We could have further simplified drawing of FBD in the first attempt. We are required to consider only translation in horizontal direction. The forces in vertical direction on block "B", as a matter of fact, may not be required for the force analysis in horizontal direction. We will learn subsequently that we can determine friction in this case by considering vertical normal force only on block "A". Thus, we can simplify drawing FBD a lot, if we have lots of experience in analyzing forces.

This example is designed to highlight the characteristics of a hinge. A hinge changes the nature of contact force at the contact between two objects.

</para>
<para id="element-53"><term>Solution : </term> 
We note that inside surface of the spherical shell is rough. It means that there will be friction between spherical shall and the rod. Thus, there are three forces operating on the rod : (i) weight of rod (ii) normal force between rod and spherical shell and (iii) friction force between rod and spherical shell. Since the rod is in contact at two end points, contact forces operate at both these end points.
